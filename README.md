Here is a list of what I did with my comments:

Your users should be able to:

### Main Points

-   [+] Make sure the design is realised as shown in an Android or iOS simulator 
-   [+] Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
-   [+] The text for the previous period's time should change based on the active timeframe. For Daily, it should read "Yesterday" e.g "Yesterday - 2hrs". For Weekly, it should read "Last Week," e.g. "Last Week - 32hrs". It should read "Last Month" for monthly, e.g., "Last Month - 19hrs".

### Extra Credit

If you complete the expected behavior described above you could extend the functionality of the app (in no particular order):

- [+] Allow switching between light and dark mode (use your judgment on sensible colors) **// I could pick not very beautiful colors :)**
- [+] Add local data persistence to allow offline mode
  - [+] Store result restrieved from given endpoint locally
  - [+] If local data is present, no need to call endpoint for data retrieval
  - [+] Allow adding new data locally (no post endpoint integration) **// Press the dots button**
- [-, Didn't understand this point] Mock data and show trends / development
  - Fake additional data for previous days / weeks / months and show the latest data compared to previous period (e.g. Yesterday 2 hours + 25% compared to day before)

I guarantee stability on IOS/Android emulators in debug mode
